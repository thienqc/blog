The pope rededicated the shrine as a Christian church. According to Venerable Bede, the pope intended \u201cthat the memory of all the saints might in the future be honored in the place which had formerly been dedicated to the worship not of gods but of demons\u201d (On the Calculation of Time).</p> <p>But the rededication of the Pantheon, like the earlier commemoration of all the martyrs, occurred in May. Many Eastern Churches still honor all the saints in the spring, either during the Easter season or immediately after Pentecost.</p> <p>How the Western Church came to celebrate this feast, now recognized as a solemnity, in November is a puzzle to historians.

Pope Clement XI extended the feast to the universal Church in 1716. And in 1913, Saint Pius X set the date for the feast that we know today of October 7.</p> <p>The development of the rosary has a long history. First a practice developed of praying 150 Our Fathers in imitation of the 150 Psalms. Then there was a parallel practice of praying 150 Hail Marys. Soon a mystery of Jesus\u2019 life was attached to each Hail Mary. Though Mary\u2019s giving of the rosary to Saint Dominic is recognized as a legend, the development of this prayer form owes much to the followers of Saint Dominic. One of them, Alan de la Roche, was known as \u201cthe apostle of the rosary.\u201d He founded the first Confraternity of the Rosary in the 15th century. In the 16th century, the rosary was developed to consist of 15 mysteries: joyful, sorrowful and glorious. In 2002, Pope John Paul II added the five Mysteries of Light to this devotion.</p>","tags":["SaintOfTheDay"]},{"location":"post/07-10-our-lady-of-the-rosary/#reflection","title":"Reflection","text":"<p>The purpose of the rosary is to help us meditate on the great mysteries of our salvation.

For the first time, I joined an English class at a center. Just 3 months, but I have lived with English more than ever before.  </p> <p>Before, when I saw foreigners, I didn\u2019t dare to talk to them. I only answered \u201cHow are you?\u201d with the sentence: \u201cI\u2019m fine, thank you, and you?\u201d \u2014 like a robot. But now, I am more confident. I can start a conversation, and I can still say \u201cI\u2019m fine, thank you, and you?\u201d \u2014 but with more confidence and good energy (just kidding \ud83d\ude04). I still have many things to improve, but I can say: the Thien now is an upgraded version of the Thien from three months ago - still buggy, but much better.  </p> <p>\"Believe in yourself.\" </p> <p>This sentence was written on a pencil my teacher gave me on the last day of class. When we start learning something new, it can feel fun (and a bit hard). But slowly, it gets more difficult, and we feel tired or bored. Finally, many people give up. I was like that too. Even though I learned English from primary school to university, I still could not talk with foreigners. I thought I had no talent for English. But this class changed that belief in me. Now, I believe that if we trust ourselves and keep trying every day \u2014 like a modern-day Sisyphus \u2014 anything is possible.  </p> <p>At the closing session, I had the chance to talk about my journey, sharing the thoughts and reflections I had gathered \u2014 all in another language. Though my words were still simple and rough, I truly believe they touched the hearts of the listeners.  </p> <p>The greatest gift from this journey isn\u2019t just what I learned, but who I met. </p> <p>Thank you, Ms. Uyen. You are not only my teacher, but also like an older sister. You listened to my simple sentences, corrected every mistake in my recordings, and also shared your life experiences and wisdom. These are important lessons that will help me in my study and work in the future.  </p> <p>Thank you to all my classmates: Anh, Bao, Cam, Chinh, Dan, Hang, Huy, Luat, Minh, Nhi, Oanh, Phat, Tri, and Tue. You walked with me through this journey. Even though it was only 3 short months, we laughed together and shared our stories. In the future, maybe we cannot continue together, but one day, we may smile happily when we remember these days.  </p> <p>Every good time must come to an end. I don\u2019t know what else to say except: THANK YOU SO MUCH. </p> <p>I wish you all peace and happiness.  </p> <p> </p> <p>3 th\u00e1ng qua t\u00f4i c\u00f3 m\u1ed9t tr\u1ea3i nghi\u1ec7m \u0111\u1eb7c bi\u1ec7t.

Narrator: Gave some words of wisdom to the final internship class of his presidency, and met with the President-Elect. - 00:15 That's November 4th through the 10th or -- The President: Be kind, be useful, be fearless. Narrator: On Tuesday, the President held a Q&amp;A with the final internship class of the Obama administration. The President: People, they say to themselves, \"Oh, I want to be a senator,\" or \"I want to be a congressman. - 00:32 \" Or in business, they say, \"I want to be rich\" as opposed to saying, \"I want to invent this great product\" or \"I want to help kids read.\" What is it that you enjoy doing, you're passionate about, that moves you, that you can throw yourself into, that you can master? Then you will naturally get really good at it and make a really important contribution. - 00:54 Narrator: On Wednesday, the President spoke to the American people about the results of the presidential election. The President: To the young people who got into politics for the first time maybe disappointed by the results, I just want you to know you have to stay encouraged. Don't get cynical. Don't ever think you can't make a difference. - 01:15 Narrator: On Thursday, the President met with the President-Elect at the White House. Afterward the President invited Alex -- The President: How have you been? You look very nice in your suit. Male Speaker: Thank you. Narrator: -- the six-year-old boy who offered to share his home and toys with a refugee in need, to stop by the White House and visit the Oval Office. - 01:30 The President: I was very proud of you.

POMC is synthesized in\u00a0\u00a0 pituitary gland, hypothalamus, medulla and some\u00a0 other tissues outside the brain. Beta-endorphin\u00a0\u00a0 is most studied and represents the bulk of\u00a0 knowledge we have about endorphins in general.\u00a0 Endorphins are released in response to a number of\u00a0 stimuli, with the major stimulus being pain.</li> <li>00:56 They\u00a0\u00a0 exert their effects by binding to opioid receptors\u00a0 in both central and peripheral nervous systems.\u00a0 In peripheral nerves, binding\u00a0 of endorphins, specifically\u00a0\u00a0 beta-endorphin, to opioid receptors, in particular\u00a0 mu-receptor, prevents the release of substance P,\u00a0\u00a0 a key factor in transmission of pain signals.\u00a0</li> <li>01:15 In the brain, the same binding between\u00a0 beta-endorphin and its receptor leads to increased\u00a0\u00a0 dopamine release. Dopamine is the neurotransmitter\u00a0 that underlies the brain reward pathway.\u00a0\u00a0 Engaging in enjoyable activities causes dopamine\u00a0 release from dopamine-producing neurons into the\u00a0\u00a0 synaptic space, where it binds to and stimulates\u00a0 dopamine-receptors on the receiving neuron.</li> <li>01:41 This\u00a0\u00a0 stimulation is believed to produce the\u00a0 pleasurable feelings or rewarding effect.\u00a0\u00a0 Normally, GABA, another neurotransmitter, inhibits\u00a0 dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens.\u00a0\u00a0 By binding to receptors on GABA inhibitory\u00a0 neurons, endorphins reduce GABA\u2019s activity,\u00a0\u00a0 ultimately increase dopamine release\u00a0 and induce pleasurable feelings.\u00a0\u00a0</li> <li>02:06 Dopamine release in response to pain signals\u00a0 may explain why pain can sometimes feel \u201cgood\u201d.\u00a0 Endorphins are also produced in response to\u00a0 pleasurable activities, meditation, laughter,\u00a0\u00a0 and vigorous exercise; and these factors have\u00a0 been shown to increase one\u2019s tolerance to pain.\u00a0\u00a0 Endorphins are thought to contribute\u00a0 to the \u201crunner\u2019s high\u201d sensation,\u00a0\u00a0 a euphoric state some people experience after\u00a0 intense exercise.</li> <li>02:38 They may also underlie \u201cexercise\u00a0\u00a0 addiction\u201d, in which the brain is desensitized due\u00a0 to repeated and excessive exposures to endorphins;\u00a0\u00a0 and people keep increasing the amount of exercise\u00a0 in order to achieve the same desired sensation</li> </ul> <code>#medical</code>","tags":["medical"]},{"location":"post/flow-dong-chay/","title":"Flow - d\u00f2ng ch\u1ea3y","text":"<p>[Author:: Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi] - (Publication_Year:: 1990)  </p> <p> </p> <p>Ebook:: \ud83d\udcd8 EPUB </p>","tags":["happiness","KhoSach"]},{"location":"post/flow-dong-chay/#highlights","title":"Highlights","text":"<p>Trong khi h\u1ea1nh ph\u00fac \u0111\u01b0\u1ee3c m\u01b0u c\u1ea7u do l\u1ee3i \u00edch c\u1ee7a ch\u00ednh n\u00f3, th\u00ec m\u1ecdi m\u1ee5c ti\u00eau kh\u00e1c \u2013 s\u1ee9c kh\u1ecfe, s\u1eafc \u0111\u1eb9p, ti\u1ec1n b\u1ea1c, hay quy\u1ec1n l\u1ef1c \u2013 \u0111\u1ec1u ch\u1ec9 c\u00f3 gi\u00e1 tr\u1ecb b\u1edfi v\u00ec ch\u00fang ta k\u1ef3 v\u1ecdng r\u1eb1ng vi\u1ec7c c\u00f3 \u0111\u01b0\u1ee3c ch\u00fang s\u1ebd khi\u1ebfn ch\u00fang ta h\u1ea1nh ph\u00fac. \u2014 location: 78 ^ref-8602  </p> <p>Tr\u1ea1ng th\u00e1i d\u00f2ng ch\u1ea3y \u2013 tr\u1ea1ng th\u00e1i m\u00e0 trong \u0111\u00f3 con ng\u01b0\u1eddi tham gia v\u00e0o m\u1ed9t ho\u1ea1t \u0111\u1ed9ng s\u00e2u s\u1eafc \u0111\u1ebfn m\u1ee9c d\u01b0\u1eddng nh\u01b0 ch\u1eb3ng c\u00f2n \u0111i\u1ec1u g\u00ec kh\u00e1c l\u00e0 quan tr\u1ecdng n\u1eefa; \u2014 location: 175 ^ref-18270  </p> <p>L\u00fd do ch\u00ednh khi\u1ebfn ch\u00fang ta r\u1ea5t kh\u00f3 \u0111\u1ea1t \u0111\u01b0\u1ee3c c\u00e1c t\u00e2m \u0111i\u1ec3m h\u1ea1nh ph\u00fac n\u1eb1m \u1edf th\u1ef1c t\u1ebf l\u00e0, tr\u00e1i v\u1edbi c\u00e1c huy\u1ec1n tho\u1ea1i m\u00e0 nh\u00e2n lo\u1ea1i \u0111\u00e3 x\u00e2y d\u1ef1ng \u0111\u1ec3 t\u1ef1 tr\u1ea5n an h\u1ecd, v\u0169 tr\u1ee5 kh\u00f4ng \u0111\u01b0\u1ee3c t\u1ea1o ra \u0111\u1ec3 \u0111\u00e1p \u1ee9ng c\u00e1c nhu c\u1ea7u c\u1ee7a ch\u00fang ta. \u2014 location: 288 ^ref-2751  </p> <p>Xem th\u00eam</p> <ul> <li>L\u00e0m g\u00ec c\u0169ng h\u0103ng say v\u00e0 kh\u00f4ng bi\u1ebft m\u1ec7t (FLOW)</li> </ul> <p></p> <code>#happiness</code> <code>#KhoSach</code>","tags":["happiness","KhoSach"]},{"location":"post/folder-tag-link/","title":"Folder - Tag - Link","text":"<p>\u2753 Mi\u0300nh n\u00ean x\u00e2y d\u01b0\u0323ng c\u00e2\u0301u tru\u0301c na\u0300o?
